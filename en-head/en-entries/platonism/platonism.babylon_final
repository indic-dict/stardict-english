tithene|matter|chora|meter|hule
Iamblichus’s term for “matter” was coined by Aristotle who said that Plato’s material principle, which was called “space” \( *chora*\) \(Tim. 52b\), “receptacle” \( *hupodoche*\), “mother” \( *meter*\), and “nurse” \( *tithene*\) \( *Tim*. 49b\), was equivalent to the term *hule*: “the receptive space \( *chora*\) of Plato’s *Timaeus* is the same as matter \( *hule*\)” \( *Physics* 209b, 11–13\). *Hule*, originally meaning “wood” or “timber,” henceforth became the technical philosophical term used by Platonists to refer to matter.
