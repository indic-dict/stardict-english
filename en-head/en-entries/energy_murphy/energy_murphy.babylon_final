substitution
refers to interchangeability between goods and services, so that an unavailable or inferior resource can be replaced by an alternative, possibly superior one. 21

terraforming
is the speculative idea of transforming the atmosphere and environment of a planet hostile to human life into one that is suited to human needs. 60, 61

Therm
is a unit of energy defined as 100,000 British thermal units, and is equivalent to 1.055 Ã— 108 Joules. 76, 335, 337, 348

thermal energy
is the energy of heat, and is really just randomized kinetic energy (motion) of atoms and molecules vibrating and zipping around. 70, 71, 84, 86, 89, 99, 165, 194, 203, 227, 246, 275, 277, 294, 334, 335, 373, 395, 396, 401, 420, 423, 427, 429, 430, 433

thermal equivalent
is a construct used to compare thermal energy sources like coal, oil, and natural gas to sources like solar, wind, and hydroelectricity, which do not derive from thermal sources. Usually in the context of electricity production, multiplying by about 2.7 puts non-thermal sources into thermal-equivalent terms. 106-108, 170, 256, 279

thermal expansion
describes how materials expand, or swell, as temperature increases. Typical rates of expansion are in the range of 5-100 ppm per Â°C. 155

thermal neutron
is a neutron whose kinetic energy (speed) is no greater than it would naturally possess based on the temperature of its surroundings. Sometimes it is called a "slow" neutron because it is not traveling faster than thermal jostling would establish. 250, 428, 432

tokamak
is the name of a donut-shaped chamber in which high-temperature plasma can be confined, and potentially used to generate fusion. 267

transmutation
describes the transformation of a nucleus into a different one, usually via neutron absorption- possibly followed by radioactive decay. 259, 268

tritium
is an isotope of hydrogen, in which the nucleus (called a triton) contains one proton and two neutrons. 265-268, 299, 438

triton
is the nucleus of tritium, consisting of one proton and two neutrons. 265, 426, 437 

turbine
is essentially fan blades on a rotating shaft, which can be compelled to move by a flow of air, water, or steam through the blades. 89, 99, 164, 175, 185, 190, 250, 279, 280, 282, 295, 430

universe
refers to the entirety of our physical realm, including all galaxies. 9, 54, 55, 257, 312, 392, 423

U-value
describes the insulating quality of a wall or similar barrier, in terms of how many Watts move through each square meter of surface area for each 1Â°C difference in temperature across the barrier. Units are W/m2/Â°C, and smaller numbers mean better insulation. The U-value is an inverse measure to the R-value, numerically 5.7/R. 87, 436

valence band
is the energy level of outer electrons bound to an atom. Valance electrons stay home, as opposed to electrons in the conduction band. 203, 422, 425

Volt
(V) is a unit of voltage, or electric potential, and can be thought of as the electrical analog to gravitational potential energy, and is also somewhat like pressure in a fluid system. 77, 198, 427, 438

voltage
is a measure of electric potential energy, expressed in units of Volts. 77, 438

Watt
(W) is a unit of power, defined so that 1 W is 1J/s (one Joule per second). 7, 18, 21, 43, 71, 77, 118, 169, 196, 267, 309, 371, 431, 434, 438

watt-hour
(Wh) is a unit of energy, constructed as a power (watts) times time (hours). It is equivalent to 3,600 Joules, or 0.001 kWh. 73, 77, 97, 110, 176, 427, 438

wavelength
measures the length of a wave from crest to crest or trough to trough, and can apply to waves in water, air (sound), or electromagnetic waves (light). The symbol A (lambda) is often used to denote wavelength. The units are length (m), often expressed in microns (um). 79, 144, 198, 283, 394, 426, 431, 434, 436

weak nuclear force
joins gravity, electromagnetism, and the strong nuclear force as one of nature's four fundamental forces, responsible for beta decays and neutrino interactions. 244, 245, 433

Wh
watt-hour. 73, 97, 98, 110, 175, 176, 438

Wien law
describes the wavelength for which the Planck spectrum is at maximum brightness. It is roughly 2.9 mm divided by the blackbody temperature, in Kelvin. 199

work
is a mechanical expression of energy, defined as a force (Newtons) times distance (meters) through which the force acts (along the same direction). The resulting unit is the Joule. 68, 84, 89, 174, 248, 379, 427
